An undergraduate thesis, and especially one that takes the form of an interdisciplinary project,
 accrues multiple debts along the way and at every step relies on the support, advice, and talents of a
 number of people. In particular, I would like to thank the following individuals whose kindness, patience,
 and conversations in person, over email, and via Skype, have all contributed to the creation of the *Corpus de textes linguistiques missionnaires* database: Professor Wendy Ayres-Bennett (University of Cambridge); Professors Joe Bray,
 Andrew Linn, Susan Fitzmaurice, Michael Pidd, and Richard Steadman-Jones (University of Sheffield);
 Professors Toon van Hal and Pierre Swiggers (University of Leuven).
