### What is missionary linguistics and why does it matter?

The study of missionary linguistics, in its broadest terms, seeks to
investigate,  contextualize, understand, and in some cases evaluate, the
missionary linguist’s contributions and approaches to the study of
language. The linguistic records created by missionaries are important,
yet underexplored sources of information about the colonial encounter
and provide insight into how the Western world has variously
conceptualized, studied, and analyzed non-Indo-European languages and
cultures. Missionary linguistic texts—which might include dictionaries,
vocabularies, grammars, translation manuals (and various combinations
and hybridizations of these categories)—aimed to record the grammatical
and lexical facts of indigenous languages as an aid to evangelization.
Insofar as they analyze, represent, and reproduce those languages on the
authors’ but not the speakers’ terms, these texts instantiate colonial
discourses of power as much as any political or legal document. Close
analysis allows us to answer questions such as: What about non-European
languages shocked, challenged, or puzzled missionary linguists? What did
they admire? At times, the texts reveal their authors’ deep appreciation
for a language or speech community; at other times, they are miniature
arenas of colonial and post-colonial processes of subordination,
exploitation, and (mis-)representation. The sheer heterogeneity of
missionary linguistic work reminds us that the range of attitudes held
by missionaries towards the languages and cultures that they studied,
documented, commented on, and were immersed in, varied greatly. It also
requires that we do our best to understand the texts with an eye to the
idiosyncrasies and biases of their authors, and to reinscribe them in
the nexus of sociocultural, political, and ideological infrastructures
in which they were produced. Understanding missionary linguistic work is
no less crucial today, since academic linguists often work alongside
linguists from missionary organizations, but with very different, and
sometimes divergent, goals.<sup>1</sup>

### Why _go digital_?

In the past decade, the study of missionary and colonial linguistics has
developed into one of the most active subfields within the history of
linguistics and linguistic-historiographical research.<sup>2</sup> With the growth
of the field, scholars increasingly recognize the need for an
interdisciplinary and collaborative approach that incorporates
methodologies from the digital humanities to make missionary linguistic
texts digitally available. Moreover, an approach is needed that
organizes, encodes, and presents those materials in a way that is
compatible with other digital corpora, and which renders the digitized
texts searchable along various parameters: namely, ‘specific
meta-language, language described, author, period, religious order,
country, region, grammatical terminology, or references to other
sources’.<sup>3</sup>

### Goals of the current project

The current project aims to respond to the need for a digital approach
to primary sources in missionary linguistics, by making a specific
collection of mission documents available to the public and presenting
them in a way that facilitates future scholarship while accommodating
users from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, and with a variety
of interests. In doing so, we hope to renew attention to older
linguistic documentation; improve understanding of earlier language
scholarship and the circulation of ethnolinguistic information; and to
contribute to present-day knowledge on the (often ill-documented)
languages recorded in missionary texts. As this is an ongoing research
project, we hope to continue to explore the ways in which the nature of
the object of study (that is, missionary linguistic texts) and the
various methodologies employed participate in a process of mutual
shaping.

### About the source texts

The 24 original source texts belong to
the <cite>Nicholas M. Williams Ethnological Collection</cite> of the the John J.
Burns Library at Boston College (Chestnut Hill, MA). This collection was
assembled and donated by Joseph J. Williams, S.J., a Jesuit missionary
and ethnologist (and former Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Boston
College), and named in honor of his father. It contains over 10,000
volumes that document the history, life, and culture of the people of
Jamaica and Africa.
