The project *Missionary Linguistics in colonial Africa / Corpus de travaux linguistiques des missionnaires* presents in digital form a variety of linguistic
analyses of languages of continental Africa and Madagascar, compiled by French Catholic
missionaries between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The <%= link_to 'corpus', texts_path %> is comprised of
multi-lingual (and multi-directional) dictionaries, descriptive grammars, vocabularies,
and various hybridizations of these genres. In addition to the catalogue of titles, the
corpus can be explored, filtered, and searched along several parameters, including: the
target language documented, author(s), missionary organization(s), and place of
publication. An interactive period map allows the texts to be explored geographically, by
place of publication and target language locus.

We have aimed to present each text in a way that renders it
easily navigable, by reconstructing the organizational hierarchies in each text, and
coordinating this clickable structure with the e-text reader. We supply bibliographic and
ethnolinguistic metadata for each text, and supplement this information with
database-external resources, like <a href="http://glottolog.org/" target="_blank">Glottolog</a> and missionary archival records. Furthermore,
the database incorporates TEI files from the <a href="http://beta.tapasproject.org/" target="_blank">TAPAS</a> repository that encode
information about the textsâ€™ authors, (mission) affiliation, and place of publication. For
more information about the principles adopted and methodologies used, see <%= link_to 'Project Praxis', praxis_path %>.

The texts presented in this database are important
historical and cultural artifacts and valuable sources of knowledge about the role played by
missionaries in collecting and circulating ethnolinguistic information about
non-Indo-European languages. They are also highly problematic works of linguistic
analysis, insofar as they were harnessed to, and legitimized, a larger ideological project
of conversion and missionization. However heterogenous, and at times uncomfortable, the
legacy of missionary linguistic activity in colonial Africa, the documents which have resulted
from the missionary enterprise are undoubtedly inscribed in the history of Western
language science, and warrant scholarly attention. For a brief summary of the field of
missionary linguistics and its relevance to the study of the history of linguistics, see
<%= link_to 'Project Overview', overview_path %>. Reading missionary linguistic texts makes significant demands on the
modern linguist, but insofar as the texts alerts us to the fact that the contours of the
history of linguistics are discontinuous, irregular, and in flux, they can
help us to cultivate hermeneutic and intercultural openness.

### About the source texts

The 24 original source texts belong to
the <a href="http://www.bc.edu/libraries/collections/collinfo/a-zlist/rarebooks.html" target="_blank">Nicholas M. Williams Ethnological Collection</a> of the the John J.
Burns Library at Boston College (Chestnut Hill, MA). This collection was
assembled and donated by Joseph J. Williams, S.J., a Jesuit missionary
and ethnologist (and former Professor of Cultural Anthropology at Boston
College), and named in honor of his father. It contains over 10,000
volumes that document the history, life, and culture of the people of
Jamaica and Africa.
